# FizzButtons

This is a play on the classic "FizzBuzz". 

Press any of the buttons to generate a random number. If this number matches the criteria 
for either Fizz, Buzz or FizzBuzz it will be displayed in the corresponding circle/bubble.

Every time you press a button a new random number is generated and matched.

Use as a developer friendly dice or start a competition to get to fill all the bubbles with 
the least amount of clics (I should add a click counter, huh?.
